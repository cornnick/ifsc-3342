        <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!--Hey Thomas!-->
        <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
        <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
        <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML.</p>
        <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
        <p>The alt attribute is used to display alternative text in the case that the element it describes, such as an image, doesn't display. The text inside the alt attribute will also display for screen readers, making it accessible for people with disabilities. The title attribute provides a tooltip when a user hovers over the element. Title attributes are typically not accessible to most screen readers.</p>
        <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
        <p><span class="definition">HTML</span> stands for <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">Hypertext Markup Language</abbr> and is used to create the structure and layout of web pages.</p>
        <h4>Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site &amp; create a style rule to change the background color of the link when the user hovers over it. </h4>
